Transfer Statements in Python

Transfer statements change the normal flow of loops.

a) break Statement
==========================
break immediately exits the loop when a condition is met.
Useful when you want to stop the loop early.

Example:
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
# Output: 0 1 2 3 4


b) continue Statement
=============================
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
Helpful when you want to ignore specific values.

Example:
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
# Output: 0 1 3 4


c) pass Statement
========================
pass does nothing — it’s a placeholder for future code.
Used in loops, functions, and classes to avoid empty-body errors.

Example:
for i in range(3):
    pass    # To be implemented later

In while loop example:
i = 1
while i <= 3:
    pass    # No action, loop runs infinitely unless changed
    i += 1
